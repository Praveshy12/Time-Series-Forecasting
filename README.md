# Time Series Forecasting

This project implements ARIMA models to forecast time series data and evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.

## Features:
- Time series analysis using ARIMA
- Model evaluation using AIC, MSE, and forecast accuracy
- Visualizing forecasts

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the forecasting script:

python forecast.py

## Results:
The model generates forecasts for future# Time-Series-Forecasting
This project uses ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) models to forecast time series data, such as stock prices, weather patterns, and sales data.
